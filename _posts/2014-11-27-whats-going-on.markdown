There has been a lot of attention towards Cachet since releasing it last week - I'm blown away by the support and great feedback I've had during this time, it's amazing to know that people like and enjoy something I've made.

In this post I'll go over everything that is happening with Cachet and how we'll be moving it forward.

## Organization

Cachet has been moved from `jbrooksuk/Cachet` to its own organization at `cachethq/Cachet` so that we can build out individual components under a group.

We now have a total of six people working on the project, including [myself](https://github.com/jbrooksuk):

### Developers

- [Philip Manavopoulos](https://github.com/manavo)
- [Elliot Hesp](https://github.com/Ehesp)
- [Thomas Coleman](https://github.com/ilikeprograms)

### Designers

- [Nick Hehr](https://github.com/HipsterBrown)
- [Rody Molenaar](https://github.com/rodymol123)

All of whom are fantastic people and are bringing a lot more to Cachet than I could by myself.

## Seal of approval

Cachet also has an incredible new logo that we love to bits. Thanks to Elliot's extremely talented girlfriend for producing this for us.

He's currently un-named and as such we're open to ideas, currently **Barry** is taking pole position for us.

## Moving forward

There is a lot to cover before the [first milestone](https://github.com/cachethq/Cachet/milestones/First%20Release) is due, however now that we have a team, we're organized and we're actively working on it, we should have no problem hitting the milestone!
