Previously I had set a date to get V1 of Cachet out and into the world, specifically I aimed for the 23rd December which has been and gone. I had even chopped a few features that I'd like to have had in to bring make that date even more realistic.

A few days later I decided that it wasn't the right thing to be doing. I shouldn't be releasing something I'm not even remotely happy with yet. Although the team have been doing great things, it just wasn't ready, missing key features is not something we should settle for. Not even for version one.

Thankfully interest in Cachet hasn't dwindled and as such a new member has joined the team, [Joe Cohen](http://joecohens.com). He's been a busy person having redesigned the status page, this site and re-designing the logo.

Above is our new logo, whilst I'm sad to see Barry the Seal go (he's awesome), I'm happy to have something which is fitting and sits within our new designs.

And our new status page, opting for a timeline view into each status. This new design moves away from the StatusPage.io layout I had originally used, whilst retaining the simplicity.

## So what's going on?

Cachet is currently very busy:

- 12 open issues.
- New timeline view.
- New logo.
- New blog and website design.
- Create incidents.
- Create, modify and delete components.
- Almost a complete API.

## What's coming?

- A finished API.
- API Documentation.
- Notification support.
- New dashboard.
- Fixed Heroku deployments.
- New setup procedures.

And yet there is so much left to do! If you're interested in helping us, take a look at the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/cachethq).
