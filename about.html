            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>
              {{ site.project_title }} is a PHP Powered application (Built using Laravel 4.3) which utilises Twitter bootstrap for the User Interface. So it is built upon well used, and tested Open Source Projects.
              {{ site.project_title }} can be used to input Incidents which have occured, which will be displayed on the status page, which gives a clear and transparent overview of your systems status.
              It will also monitor for any changes to the status, and will automatically push out to Third Party Service, so your customers (and your staff) can know as an Incident occurs or changes status.</p>
